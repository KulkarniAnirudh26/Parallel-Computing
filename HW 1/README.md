# Parallel-Computing

The Problem statement is given in the EE 451 F 2019 PHW 1.pdf

Problem1_trial.cpp is an example of naive matrix multiplication. 
block_matrix.cpp is an example of naive implementation of K-means algorithm. 
The input and output files for Kmeans algorithm is as follows:
Input - input.raw
Output - output.raw

These files can be visualized using ImageJ software
